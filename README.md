The code you see is a code for a car that I made made on 6/13/2024, it works by going forward and backward.
If you press the number 1 then the mode changes to "D" for drive and if you click the number 2 then it will change to "R" for reverse.
If you press the up arrow then it will increase in speed, if you press the back arrow it will decrease in speed.
If you press the # button then the back will go up, if you press the * then the back will go back down.
The speed and the mode are displayed on a LCD, Liquid Crystal Display, in the front window.
